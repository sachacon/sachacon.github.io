Senior Design Fall 2020
------
* Short Summary of this Project in the "Senior Design" page
* Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network onto a PYNQ FPGA board using TVM compiler and VTA Accelerator
* Writing Python code to optimize accelerator architecture performance and tune operator scheduling

SSP UART Verification - EE382M-11
------
* Worked with graduate team to verify Synchronous Serial Port with UART communication
* Formally verified design with assertion properties written in System Verilog and proven with Cadence Jaspergold
* Contributed to writing UVM testbench and FPGA prototype verification
* RTL Source Code: [SSP_UART](https://opencores.org/projects/ssp_uart)
* Verification Code: Coming Soon 

Schematic-Level ALU Design - EE460R
------
* Designed 16-bit ALU in Cadence Virtuoso with Kogge-Stone adder, magnitude comparator, and shift capability
* Tested functionality with NC Verilog and ran static timing analysis with Synopsys Primetime
* Utilized Cadence Encounter for Automatic Place and Route layout stage

Op-Amp Based Transceiver Chain Simulation Fall 2020
------
* Designed op-amp signal chain of 1st Order Delta Sigma Modulation, LED driver, photodiode receiver, amplifier, and active filter stages
* Simulated in LTspice by inputting and recovering .wav file and built transmit and receive chains separately on a breadboard
